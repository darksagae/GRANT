Predictive AI modelling to generate a program that will predict the weather changes in Uganda

Abstract
Here we investigate the AI models of whether forecasting based on the machine languages which allow as to calculate meteorological parameters based on Uganda in local areas. A new method of predicting weather changes to obtain a more accurate results basing on AI driven program is proposed. An algorithm is presented based on which the most accurate meteorological forecast was based on the result of study this algorithm can be used in wide range of situations such as obtaining data for the operation of equipment in a given location and studying meteorological parameters of the location.To build this AI model, we use data obtained from personal weather stations and Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA). This  methodology includes data collection, the model development and validation against traditional forecasting methods. he results demonstrate that AI models can outperform traditional methods, providing reliable forecasts tailored to Ugandaâ€™s regional climatic variations. This system has broad applications, including optimizing agricultural operations, improving early warning systems, and supporting infrastructure planning.

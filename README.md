Predictive AI modelling to generate a program that will predict the weather changes in Uganda

Abstract
Here we investigate the AI models of whether forecasting based on the machine languages which allow as to calculate meteorological parameters based on Uganda in local areas. A new method of predicting weather changes to obtain a more accurate results basing on AI driven program is proposed. An algorithm is presented based on which the most accurate meteorological forecast was based on the result of study this algorithm can be used in wide range of situations such as obtaining data for the operation of equipment in a given location and studying meteorological parameters of the location.To build this AI model, we use data obtained from personal weather stations and Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA). This  methodology includes data collection, the model development and validation against traditional forecasting methods. he results demonstrate that AI models can outperform traditional methods, providing reliable forecasts tailored to Ugandaâ€™s regional climatic variations. This system has broad applications, including optimizing agricultural operations, improving early warning systems, and supporting infrastructure planning.



INTRODUCTION

Uganda's Agricultural sector is a significant contributor to the country's economy carrying 25% of the National Gross Domestic Product. Accurate prediction of weather parameters are essential for farmers to plan planting and harvesting, for water resource management and for mitigating the impacts of natural disasters. However the sector is heavily reliant on favorable weather conditions, with drought, floods and other weather events causing a risk to crop yields. Despite the importance for agricultural decision making, Uganda's forecasting capabilities are limited with few weather stations and inadequate data analysis capacity. This results into inaccurate and unreliable weather forecast making it difficult for the farmer to make decisions about planting, harvesting and crop management. This project aims to create driven program in relation to Uganda's climatic conditions using data from UNMA and personal weather forecast stations to produces forecast that are  both accurate and accessible through employing languages like python for rapid development and C++ for computation efficiency.

PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Uganda's agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to the unpredictable weather patterns like floods and drought despite the advancement in traditional dynamical model there remains a need for more accurate and reliable seasonal weather predictions. These climatic changes threatens the crop yields, food security and livelihood particular for small holder farmers who rely on the rain fed agriculture. There is a need for region specific forecast to local industries. The country's weather forecasting capabilities are limited due to sparse network of weather stations outdated infrastructure and inadequate data analysis capacity. For this case the current forecast are often inaccurate and lack the regional specificity need for effective agriculture decision making for example planning, planting and harvesting schedules. This research addresses these gaps by developing a program that uses AI modeling with advanced AI techniques to predict the weather changes ahead with high precision focusing on creating a model applicable to specific regions while ensuring the computational efficiency and adaptability to evolving climate patterns. This gap in reliable weather predictions hinders the farmer's ability to mitigate risks and to adapt variability, optimize resources leading to economic loses

Predictive AI modelling to generate a program that will predict the weather changes in Uganda

Abstract
Here we investigate the AI models of whether forecasting based on the machine languages which allow as to calculate meteorological parameters based on Uganda in local areas. A new method of predicting weather changes to obtain a more accurate results basing on AI driven program is proposed. An algorithm is presented based on which the most accurate meteorological forecast was based on the result of study this algorithm can be used in wide range of situations such as obtaining data for the operation of equipment in a given location and studying meteorological parameters of the location.To build this AI model, we use data obtained from personal weather stations and Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA). This  methodology includes data collection, the model development and validation against traditional forecasting methods. he results demonstrate that AI models can outperform traditional methods, providing reliable forecasts tailored to Uganda’s regional climatic variations. This system has broad applications, including optimizing agricultural operations, improving early warning systems, and supporting infrastructure planning.



INTRODUCTION

Uganda's Agricultural sector is a significant contributor to the country's economy carrying 25% of the National Gross Domestic Product. Accurate prediction of weather parameters are essential for farmers to plan planting and harvesting, for water resource management and for mitigating the impacts of natural disasters. However the sector is heavily reliant on favorable weather conditions, with drought, floods and other weather events causing a risk to crop yields. Despite the importance for agricultural decision making, Uganda's forecasting capabilities are limited with few weather stations and inadequate data analysis capacity. This results into inaccurate and unreliable weather forecast making it difficult for the farmer to make decisions about planting, harvesting and crop management. This project aims to create driven program in relation to Uganda's climatic conditions using data from UNMA and personal weather forecast stations to produces forecast that are  both accurate and accessible through employing languages like python for rapid development and C++ for computation efficiency.

PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Uganda's agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to the unpredictable weather patterns like floods and drought despite the advancement in traditional dynamical model there remains a need for more accurate and reliable seasonal weather predictions. These climatic changes threatens the crop yields, food security and livelihood particular for small holder farmers who rely on the rain fed agriculture. There is a need for region specific forecast to local industries. The country's weather forecasting capabilities are limited due to sparse network of weather stations outdated infrastructure and inadequate data analysis capacity. For this case the current forecast are often inaccurate and lack the regional specificity need for effective agriculture decision making for example planning, planting and harvesting schedules. This research addresses these gaps by developing a program that uses AI modeling with advanced AI techniques to predict the weather changes ahead with high precision focusing on creating a model applicable to specific regions while ensuring the computational efficiency and adaptability to evolving climate patterns. This gap in reliable weather predictions hinders the farmer's ability to mitigate risks and to adapt variability, optimize resources leading to economic loses

AIM OF RESEARCH

This research aim to develop a program using an AI modeling cable of predicting weather changes with high accuracy. 

Develop an AI model to predict weather forecasting system using machine learning to achieve high accuracy than the traditional methods.
To provide recommendation for integrating AI based seasonal forecast into operational by meteorological services and local farmers 
To strengthen and improve early warning system for floods and drought to reduce economic loses.
To provide farmers with reliable forecast optimize planting, harvesting and resource management hence enhancing agricultural productive 
To ensure accessibility through delivering forecasts through user friendly mobile interfaces connected to rural communities 

JUSTIFICATIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE

Reliable weather forecasts are essential to plan planting schedules based on the expected rain fall or temperature patterns, harvesting and research management to maximize crop yields and sustain livelihoods. The current lack of accurate predictions leads to significant loses from weather disasters.
Anticipating droughts and floods helps to optimize water resource allocations crucial for environment facing climate variability.
Early warning of extreme events like heavy rain fall enable better mitigation strategies with AI models. Traditional forecasting face limitations due to computations demands and challenges in capturing long term variability under climate change. This research is significant because it addresses a critical gap in long term weather prediction by developing an AI driven model.
It contributes to broader effects in climate science by exploring machine language application in environmental science 

LITERATURE REVIEW

The development of AI driven forecasting system in Uganda builds on a growing body of research highlighting the potential of machine learning to enhance meteorological predictions. This review synthesizes the key studies on weather forecasting, AI application in meteorology and specific challenges of Uganda agricultural and climatic context to justify the proposed project. 

Machine learning offers a solution by analysis sparse heterogeneous data to deliver accurate forecast. Studies in India and Kenya demonstrates AI usability to improve predictions and boost yields through localized forecast. In Africa machine learning, has enhanced decision making in Rwanda seeing gains in agricultural outcomes via mobile based systems. However some challenges like low data literacy require use friendly interfaces. 

Accurate weather forecasting is critical for agricultural planning and disaster preparedness. In Uganda, the UNMA operates fewer weather stations far below the world meteorological organisation's density. This sparsity results into unreliable forecast that fail to capture region micro climates such as the humid lake Victoria and semi arid Karamoja region. The limitations directly affect farmers who rely on precise prediction for planting and harvesting.

Traditional numerical weather prediction models require computation resource and dense data input making it less feasible for countries like Uganda. Studies emphasize the need for alternative approaches that leverage sparse data and affordable technology to deliver localized forecast

Current research lacks integration of UNMA and personal weather station data to focus on practical deliver to farmers. The proposed project addresses these gaps leveraging diverse data sources and accessible platform promising to enhance agricultural resilience and food security in Uganda's vulnerable context. In developing context AI has shown a promise for bridging gaps. For example in Kenya, Ngugi et al (2021) developed an ML based system combining weather station and remote sensing data to provide farm level forecasts which improved maize yields by 12%. With this potential of AI, this highlights it's ability to adapt to a sparse heterogeneous data which is a critical feature for Uganda where station coverage is limited. 

Uganda's agricultural contributing 25% to GDP is predominately rain fed making it sensitive to weather variability. Localised forecasting is particularly critical given Uganda's diverse micro climate. Integrating data from personal weather station as proposed could address this by providing annual predictions.

AI's potential in agriculture extends beyond forecasting to decision support and optimization. In Rwanda a pilot project by the CGIAR delivered a machine learning based weather alert via SMS which boosted the farmer adoption of climate by 25%, this demonstrates the feasibility of deploying AI in low resource settings particular through mobile platforms accessible to rural communities
